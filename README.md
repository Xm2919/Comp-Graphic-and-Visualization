## How do I approach designing software?
I would approach designing software by understanding what is needed. For example, one of the things I need to do is make my complex object, a vase, look like the picture. With my skills, I have tried to use shapes to build my vase. Then I add texture and light to my project. If what is needed is not clear, I could simply ask my instructor for more details. That way, I do not make a project the wrong way. I could also get help from people who know more about programming. Getting feedback is really helpful when creating projects. These steps will help me in the future when working on projects. When making a project, understanding what is needed can help me know what to make. When it is not clear, I can talk with the client through interviews, surveys, and group meetings, and I can get a better idea of what is needed so that the project turns out well. Getting feedback makes code better, helps developers learn and improve, and saves time. It helps find and fix problems early, makes what is needed clearer, and helps the team work together and feel more confident.


## How do I approach developing programs?
  After understanding what is needed, I will start building the software and test it many times. When I worked on the project, it was my first time using the program. Testing often helped me learn how to use it and made sure there were no mistakes in the code. For example, when working on the shape for my vase, I had to keep testing the code to make sure I did it right. I did this for every part of my project, from making the shape to adding lights and controls. As I worked on the code and finished the project, I learned and improved. When I got stuck, I was not afraid to look for help. I learned that it is okay to be stuck and ask for help. People can forget things, so now I am not afraid to look things up.



## How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
  Computer science is a field that can greatly enhance one's skills and knowledge in various fields. It fosters computational thinking, enabling the breakdown of complex problems and the identification of patterns. This knowledge is crucial for creating innovative solutions in various fields, including academics and life. Mastering computer science skills, such as computational graphics and visualizations, can improve comprehension, strengthen analysis, and enhance communication. These skills are directly applicable to the video game industry, allowing for the creation of visual assets, animations, and simulations. Additionally, computer science knowledge can be applied to other tech careers, such as medical imaging visualizations, engineering simulations, and virtual and augmented reality applications. This knowledge can lead to innovative contributions in fields like entertainment, healthcare, and education.
